💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection System
🌟 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning-based solution to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a Logistic Regression model, it identifies anomalies in transaction patterns and flags suspicious activities, providing a foundation for secure financial systems.

🗂️ Dataset
The project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset containing:

284,807 transactions
Class Distribution:
0: Legitimate transactions
1: Fraudulent transactions (0.17%)
Note: The dataset is highly imbalanced, reflecting real-world scenarios.

🛠️ Project Workflow
Data Exploration & Preprocessing:
Checked and handled missing values.
Addressed class imbalance with undersampling.
Feature Engineering:
Retained essential features like transaction Amount and anonymized components (V1 to V28).
Model Training & Evaluation:
Trained a Logistic Regression model.
Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Transaction Classification:
Added functionality to classify individual transactions as Legit or Fraudulent.
